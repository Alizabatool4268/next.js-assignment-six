# Introduction 
This project is a fully responsive clone of a Figma-designed landing page, created to demonstrate my front-end development skills. The landing page is thoughtfully structured into multiple sections to ensure intuitive navigation and a smooth user experience. Each section is designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, focusing on visual hierarchy and usability.

The design is fully responsive across all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and larger screens, ensuring consistent performance and appearance regardless of the user’s device. This project serves as a showcase of my ability to translate static UI designs into pixel-perfect, responsive web pages using modern front-end technologies. The landing page is currently static, with no dynamic data integration, which allowed me to concentrate purely on layout, styling, and responsiveness. 

# Tech Stack
#### Next.js:
Utilized as the React framework to structure and optimize the project for performance and scalability.

#### Tailwind CSS:
Employed for efficient styling with a utility-first approach, enabling rapid UI development with a consistent design system.

#### TypeScript:
Used throughout the project to ensure type safety, improve code readability, and prevent potential runtime errors during development.


# Challenges Faced
#### Responsive Layout Issues:
Initially, aligning elements across different screen sizes was challenging, especially when dealing with nested flex and grid containers. I overcame this by refining breakpoints and leveraging Tailwind’s responsive utilities.

#### Pixel-perfect Conversion:
Achieving exact pixel alignment with the original Figma design required meticulous adjustments and frequent comparisons.

#### Typography & Spacing Consistency:
Ensuring uniformity in font sizes, margins, and paddings throughout the layout was critical to maintaining a polished look.


# What I Learned
#### Figma-to-Code Translation:
Improved my ability to interpret Figma designs and convert them into fully functional, responsive web pages.

#### Mastering Tailwind CSS:
Gained hands-on experience using Tailwind's utility classes for rapid UI development and responsive design.

#### TypeScript Integration: 
Deepened my understanding of TypeScript, particularly in typing components and props to avoid common runtime errors.

#### Next.js Fundamentals:
Strengthened my grasp of Next.js routing, component organization, and static page generation.
