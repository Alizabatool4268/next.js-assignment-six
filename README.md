# Introduction 
This project is a fully responsive clone of a Figma-designed landing page, created to demonstrate my front-end development skills. The landing page is thoughtfully structured into multiple sections to ensure intuitive navigation and a smooth user experience. Each section is designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, focusing on visual hierarchy and usability.

The design is fully responsive across all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and larger screens, ensuring consistent performance and appearance regardless of the userâ€™s device. This project serves as a showcase of my ability to translate static UI designs into pixel-perfect, responsive web pages using modern front-end technologies. The landing page is currently static, with no dynamic data integration, which allowed me to concentrate purely on layout, styling, and responsiveness.
